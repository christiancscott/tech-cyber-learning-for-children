## ‚ú® About
This is an informal compendium (WIP) of general technology, software development, cybersecurity, and 3D printing resources, guides, and tools specifically directed toward children/students between the ages 4 - 15. Most standard school curricula on these topics that I have encountered have been a bit lackluster, so I wanted to create this quick "awesome list" for various friends and family.
If you feel like you have a few good gems to suggest, just let me know or put in a PR. Hopefully, this is helpful! ü§©
